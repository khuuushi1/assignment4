            <h1>ABOUT ME and Artist Statement</h1>
            <h2>I am Khushi Bundela</h2>
            <p>I joined RMIT in 2022 to study digital media.<br> Although, I am mostly interested in learning about games as I want to pursue game development.<br>
            I really love talking about games. Mostly, everything i did in all the Assignments were inspired by games. Except, the first one.<br>
        My favourite assignment was the third one as it was closest to working on games. And I treated that assignment as a tribute to my favourite games. <br>
    It was very important for me to get it right. Art is not my strongest forte at all. But I feel like I have grown as an UX/UI designer. <br> I am really glad to be taken on this journey.
    I mostly worked with video editing, UX/UI designs, website and 3D environment. I really hope to showcase how I progressed through the semester.

            <h1>ASSIGNMENT 1</h1>
            <h2> Q1. How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of 
                your edit? </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Ans.</b> I wanted to visualise horror and with a song I found on Youtube music library. <br>I could achieve that. For example, in the video, there is a part where someone breaks<br>
                into a house and the music turns very eerie to emphasis that.
            </p>
            <h2> Q2. How did you decide on which parts of the existing footage you would use to shape your 
                project? </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Ans.</b> actually  struggled this with a lot.<br> As I was watching the video, some clips  flow into each other to create that horror feeling I was going for. <br>
                    However, a a lot of themn felt out of sync. So, I figured a way to flow them into each other, with the help of dialogues found in the other video. 
                </p>
                <h2> Q3. What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how 
                    did you apply this knowledge to your project?  </h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Ans.</b>Music/sound has the ability to evoke powerful emotional response such as chills and thrills.<br> Like I said, I wanted to make the viewer scared and with<br>
                        the help of the eerie muisc, I think, I did.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Q4. How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use 
                        these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?   </h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ans.</b> I wanted to tell a story about some children being alone and getting stalked by a ghost or a stalker.The problem was <br>
                            a lot of these clips didn't had a flow to them, if that makes sense. I had no idea how to connect them. So, in order to give this video<br>a good pacing/structure
                            I introduced all three characters, established the similarity among them and I establsihed the rhytm by scaring all of them
                        </p>
                        <h2> Q5. Why did you choose the theme, concept, or genre that you did?  </h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ans.</b> The title of the video was "Alone at home" which to me, screamed horror.<br>
                            So, I choose it because it makes perfect sense to me. I did not struggled with this decision at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>END RESULT:</b>
                        </p>

            <h1>ASSIGNMENT 2</h1>
            <h2> Q1. How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose 
                the theme that you did?  </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Ans.</b> So, basically, I wanted to repliacte night life in a futurisitc city.<br>
                    I honestly chose it becauae I thought it was cool.
                </p>
                <h2> Q2. Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed 
                    across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with? </h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Ans.</b>Not really, no. I quite struggled with this assignment.<br>
                        As I wanted to do something compliacted but Cy gave us a lecture about flast design and I relaised, I had to scratch the idea.<br>
                        So, I ended up struggling until the very end.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Q3. How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? 
                        Was anything lost in that translation, or gained? </h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ans.</b> This is a very hard question to answer. I am not sure,actually. As my thumbnail sketches were really bad and even though I do think the <br>
                            final design are better. I don't think they achieved what I wanted to do.
                        </p>
                        <h2> Q4. How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why 
                            did you choose the palette that you did? </h2>
                            <p>
                                <b>Ans.</b> I associate neon colour with night life. So, in order to establish unity<br>
                                I used neon colour in all icons.
                            </p>
                            <h2> Q5. How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design 
                                correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?  </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Ans.</b> I used the sounds of the things that were there in the icons. <br>
                                    Like, if there is a glass, when you hover over it, you can hear, a clinking sound.<br>
                                    So, in that way the visuals and audio are matching.
                                </p>

            <h1>ASSIGNMENT 3</h1>
            <h2> Q1. How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that 
                process? </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Ans.</b> Very important. When I was ddeveloping, there were things I liked but having a working prototype I relaised it didn't. 
                </p>
                <h2> Q2. How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment 
                    differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional 
                    media? </h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Ans.</b> Pretty good actually. I was really looking forward to this assignment as It was somewhat related games. Working in 2D media, we just had to<br>
                        look fron one perspective. While in 3D media, mean we have to look things from all this any direction.<br>
                        Like, I noticed a certain building from left side but as I moved around it, it was awkawrdly placed and the, I fixed it.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Q3. What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and 
                        different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?  </h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ans.</b>I woukd say so, Yes! At least, in conecpt. Both Cemeras are following a point of view<br>
                            The only difference is the viewer, in this case, a player.
                        </p>
                        <h2> Q4. How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your 
                            use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?</h2>

                            <p>
                                <b>Ans.</b> I think, It was mostly similar to Assignment 1 as I both had background music. In this assignment, It is a tribute to my favourite<br>
                                games so I used my favourite song from the album.
                            </p>
                            <h2> Q5. What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have 
                                discovered otherwise?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Ans.</b> Play testing highlighted very important stuff to me. Where do I intend to send the player first. <br>
                                    So, I added, actually, removed some overgrown grass to create paths that would lead the player to places.<br>
                                    I also, added weapons as rewrads for exploring.
                                </p>
